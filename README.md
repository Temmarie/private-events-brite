## Private-Events

ruby on rails project

In this project, we built a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties. Events take place at a specific date.

## About the project
A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. This will require you to model many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about your foreign keys and class names (hint: you won’t be able to just rely on Rails’ defaults like you have before).

## Built With
-ruby on rails
-ruby

## Usage
$ git clone git@github.com:Temmarie/private-events-brite.git
$ bundle install -> run this command to install the required gems
$ rails server -> run this command in terminal, then open localhost.3000 in your web-server
